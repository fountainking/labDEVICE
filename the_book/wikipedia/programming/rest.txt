REST

REST is a software architectural style
that was created to describe the design
and guide the development of the
architecture for the World Wide Web.
REST defines a set of constraints for
how the architecture of a distributed,
Internet-scale hypermedia system, such
as the Web, should behave. The REST
architectural style emphasizes uniform
interfaces, independent deployment of
components, the scalability of
interactions between them, and creating
a layered architecture to promote
caching to reduce user-perceived
latency, enforce security, and
encapsulate legacy systems.
