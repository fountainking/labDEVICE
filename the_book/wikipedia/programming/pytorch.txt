PyTorch

PyTorch is an open-source machine
learning library based on the Torch
library, used for applications such as
computer vision, deep learning research
and natural language processing,
originally developed by Meta AI and now
part of the Linux Foundation umbrella.
It is one of the most popular deep
learning frameworks, alongside others
such as TensorFlow, offering free and
open-source software released under the
modified BSD license. Although the
Python interface is more polished and
the primary focus of development,
PyTorch also has a C++ interface.
