Swift (programming language)

Swift is a high-level general-purpose,
multi-paradigm, compiled programming
language created by Chris Lattner in
2010 for Apple Inc. and maintained by
the open-source community. Swift
compiles to machine code and uses an
LLVM-based compiler. Swift was first
released in June 2014 and the Swift
toolchain has shipped in Xcode since
Xcode version 6, released in September
2014.
