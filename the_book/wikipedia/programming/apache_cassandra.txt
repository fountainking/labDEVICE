Apache Cassandra

Apache Cassandra is a free and
open-source database management system
designed to handle large volumes of
data across multiple commodity servers.
The system prioritizes availability and
scalability over consistency, making it
particularly suited for systems with
high write throughput requirements due
to its LSM tree indexing storage layer.
As a wide-column database, Cassandra
supports flexible schemas and
efficiently handles data models with
numerous sparse columns. The system is
optimized for applications with
well-defined data access patterns that
can be incorporated into the schema
design. Cassandra supports computer
clusters which may span multiple data
centers, featuring asynchronous and
masterless replication. It enables
low-latency operations for all clients
and incorporates Amazon's Dynamo
distributed storage and replication
techniques, combined with Google's
Bigtable data storage engine model.
