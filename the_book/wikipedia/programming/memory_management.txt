Memory management

Memory management is a form of resource
management applied to computer memory.
The essential requirement of memory
management is to provide ways to
dynamically allocate portions of memory
to programs at their request, and free
it for reuse when no longer needed.
This is critical to any advanced
computer system where more than a
single process might be underway
(multitasking) at any time.
