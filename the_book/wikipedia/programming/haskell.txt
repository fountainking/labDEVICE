Haskell

Haskell is a general-purpose,
statically typed, purely functional
programming language with type
inference and lazy evaluation. Haskell
pioneered several programming language
features including type classes for
type-safe operator overloading and
monadic input/output (IO). It is named
after logician Haskell Curry. Haskell's
main implementation is the Glasgow
Haskell Compiler (GHC).
