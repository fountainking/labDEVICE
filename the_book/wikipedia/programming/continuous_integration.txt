Continuous integration

Continuous integration (CI) is the
practice of integrating source code
changes frequently and ensuring that
the integrated codebase is in a
workable state. Typically, developers
merge changes to an integration branch,
and an automated system builds and
tests the software system.
Often, the automated process runs on
each commit or runs on a schedule such
as once a day. Grady Booch first
proposed the term CI in 1991, although
he did not advocate integrating
multiple times a day, but later, CI
came to include that aspect.
