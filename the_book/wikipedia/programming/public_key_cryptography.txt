Public-key cryptography

Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric
cryptography, is the field of
cryptographic systems that use pairs of
related keys. Each key pair consists of
a public key and a corresponding
private key. Key pairs are generated
with cryptographic algorithms based on
mathematical problems termed one-way
functions. Security of public-key
cryptography depends on keeping the
private key secret; the public key can
be openly distributed without
compromising security. There are many
kinds of public-key cryptosystems, with
different security goals, including
digital signature, Diffie–Hellman key
exchange, public-key key encapsulation,
and public-key encryption.
