SQLite

SQLite is a free and open-source
relational database engine written in
the C programming language. It is not a
standalone app; rather, it is a library
that software developers embed in their
apps. As such, it belongs to the family
of embedded databases. According to its
developers, SQLite is the most widely
deployed database engine, as it is used
by several of the top web browsers,
operating systems, mobile phones, and
other embedded systems.
