Computer virus

A computer virus is a type of malware
that, when executed, replicates itself
by modifying other computer programs
and inserting its own code into those
programs. If this replication succeeds,
the affected areas are then said to be
"infected" with a computer virus, a
metaphor derived from biological
viruses.
