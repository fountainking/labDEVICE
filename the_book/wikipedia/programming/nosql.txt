NoSQL

NoSQL refers to a type of database
design that stores and retrieves data
differently from the traditional
table-based structure of relational
databases. Unlike relational databases,
which organize data into rows and
columns like a spreadsheet, NoSQL
databases use a single data
structure—such as key–value pairs, wide
columns, graphs, or documents—to hold
information. Since this non-relational
design does not require a fixed schema,
it scales easily to manage large, often
unstructured datasets. NoSQL systems
are sometimes called "Not only SQL"
because they can support SQL-like query
languages or work alongside SQL
databases in polyglot-persistent
setups, where multiple database types
are combined. Non-relational databases
date back to the late 1960s, but the
term "NoSQL" emerged in the early
2000s, spurred by the needs of Web 2.0
companies like social media platforms.
