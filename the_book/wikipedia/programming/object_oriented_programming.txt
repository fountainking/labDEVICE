Object-oriented programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a
programming paradigm based on the
object – a software entity that
encapsulates data and function(s). An
OOP computer program consists of
objects that interact with one another.
A programming language that provides
OOP features is classified as an OOP
language but as the set of features
that contribute to OOP is contended,
classifying a language as OOP and the
degree to which it supports or is OOP,
are debatable. As paradigms are not
mutually exclusive, a language can be
multi-paradigm; can be categorized as
more than only OOP.
