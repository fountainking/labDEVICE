Microservices

In software engineering, a microservice
architecture is an architectural
pattern that organizes an application
into a collection of loosely coupled,
fine-grained services that communicate
through lightweight protocols. This
pattern is characterized by the ability
to develop and deploy services
independently, improving modularity,
scalability, and adaptability. However,
it introduces additional complexity,
particularly in managing distributed
systems and inter-service
communication, making the initial
implementation more challenging
compared to a monolithic architecture.
