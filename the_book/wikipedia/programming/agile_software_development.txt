Agile software development

Agile software development is an
umbrella term for approaches to
developing software that reflect the
values and principles agreed upon by
The Agile Alliance, a group of 17
software practitioners, in 2001. As
documented in their Manifesto for Agile
Software Development, the practitioners
value:Individuals and interactions over
processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive
documentation
Customer collaboration over contract
negotiation
Responding to change over following a
plan
