Big O notation

Big O notation is a mathematical
notation that describes the limiting
behavior of a function when the
argument tends towards a particular
value or infinity. Big O is a member of
a family of notations invented by
German mathematicians Paul Bachmann,
Edmund Landau, and others, collectively
called Bachmann–Landau notation or
asymptotic notation. The letter O was
chosen by Bachmann to stand for
Ordnung, meaning the order of
approximation.
