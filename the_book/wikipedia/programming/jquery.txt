JQuery

jQuery is a JavaScript library designed
to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and
manipulation, as well as event
handling, CSS animations, and Ajax. It
is free, open-source software using the
permissive MIT License. As of August
2022, jQuery is used by 77% of the 10
million most popular websites. Web
analysis indicates that it is the most
widely deployed JavaScript library by a
large margin, having at least three to
four times more usage than any other
JavaScript library.
