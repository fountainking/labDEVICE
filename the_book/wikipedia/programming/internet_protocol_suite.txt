Internet protocol suite

The Internet protocol suite, commonly
known as TCP/IP, is a framework for
organizing the communication protocols
used in the Internet and similar
computer networks according to
functional criteria. The foundational
protocols in the suite are the
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP),
the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and
the Internet Protocol (IP). Early
versions of this networking model were
known as the Department of Defense
(DoD) Internet Architecture Model
because the research and development
were funded by the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the
United States Department of Defense.
