Kernel (operating system)

A kernel is a computer program at the
core of a computer's operating system
that always has complete control over
everything in the system. The kernel is
also responsible for preventing and
mitigating conflicts between different
processes. It is the portion of the
operating system code that is always
resident in memory and facilitates
interactions between hardware and
software components. A full kernel
controls all hardware resources via
device drivers, arbitrates conflicts
between processes concerning such
resources, and optimizes the use of
common resources, such as CPU, cache,
file systems, and network sockets. On
most systems, the kernel is one of the
first programs loaded on startup. It
handles the rest of startup as well as
memory, peripherals, and input/output
(I/O) requests from software,
translating them into data-processing
instructions for the central processing
unit.
