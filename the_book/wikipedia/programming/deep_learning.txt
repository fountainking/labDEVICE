Deep learning

In machine learning, deep learning
focuses on utilizing multilayered
neural networks to perform tasks such
as classification, regression, and
representation learning. The field
takes inspiration from biological
neuroscience and is centered around
stacking artificial neurons into layers
and "training" them to process data.
The adjective "deep" refers to the use
of multiple layers in the network.
Methods used can be supervised,
semi-supervised or unsupervised.
