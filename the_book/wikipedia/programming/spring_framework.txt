Spring Framework

The Spring Framework is an application
framework and inversion of control
container for the Java platform. The
framework's core features can be used
by any Java application, but there are
extensions for building web
applications on top of the Java EE
platform. The framework does not impose
any specific programming model.. The
framework has become popular in the
Java community as an addition to the
Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) model. The
Spring Framework is free and open
source software.
