WebSocket

WebSocket is a computer communications
protocol, providing a bidirectional
communication channel over a single
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
connection. The WebSocket protocol was
standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in
2011. The current specification
allowing web applications to use this
protocol is known as WebSockets. It is
a living standard maintained by the
WHATWG and a successor to The WebSocket
API from the W3C.
