Queue (abstract data type)

In computer science, a queue is an
abstract data type that serves as an
ordered collection of entities. By
convention, the end of the queue where
elements are added, is called the back,
tail, or rear of the queue. The end of
the queue where elements are removed is
called the head or front of the queue.
The name queue is an analogy to the
words used to describe people in line
to wait for goods or services. It
supports two main operations.Enqueue,
which adds one element to the rear of
the queue
Dequeue, which removes one element from
the front of the queue.
