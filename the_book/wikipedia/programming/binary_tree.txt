Binary tree

In computer science, a binary tree is a
tree data structure in which each node
has at most two children, referred to
as the left child and the right child.
That is, it is a k-ary tree where k =
2. A recursive definition using set
theory is that a binary tree is a
triple (L, S, R), where L and R are
binary trees or the empty set and S is
a singleton (a single–element set)
containing the root.
