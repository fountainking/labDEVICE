Reinforcement learning

In machine learning and optimal
control, reinforcement learning (RL) is
concerned with how an intelligent agent
should take actions in a dynamic
environment in order to maximize a
reward signal. Reinforcement learning
is one of the three basic machine
learning paradigms, alongside
supervised learning and unsupervised
learning.
