API

An application programming interface
(API) is a connection between computers
or between computer programs. It is a
type of software interface, offering a
service to other pieces of software. A
document or standard that describes how
to build such a connection or interface
is called an API specification. A
computer system that meets this
standard is said to implement or expose
an API. The term API may refer either
to the specification or to the
implementation.
