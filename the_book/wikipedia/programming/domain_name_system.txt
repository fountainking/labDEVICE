Domain Name System

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a
hierarchical and distributed name
service that provides a naming system
for computers, services, and other
resources on the Internet or other
Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It
associates various information with
domain names assigned to each of the
associated entities. Most prominently,
it translates readily memorized domain
names to the numerical IP addresses
needed for locating and identifying
computer services and devices with the
underlying network protocols. The
Domain Name System has been an
essential component of the
functionality of the Internet since
1985.
