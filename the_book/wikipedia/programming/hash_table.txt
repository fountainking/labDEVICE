Hash table

In computer science, a hash table is a
data structure that implements an
associative array, also called a
dictionary or simply map; an
associative array is an abstract data
type that maps keys to values. A hash
table uses a hash function to compute
an index, also called a hash code, into
an array of buckets or slots, from
which the desired value can be found.
During lookup, the key is hashed and
the resulting hash indicates where the
corresponding value is stored. A map
implemented by a hash table is called a
hash map.
