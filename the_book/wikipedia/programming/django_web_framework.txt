Django (web framework)

Django is a free and open-source,
Python-based web framework that runs on
a web server. It follows the
model–template–views (MTV)
architectural pattern. It is maintained
by the Django Software Foundation
(DSF), an independent organization
established in the US as a 501(c)(3)
non-profit.
