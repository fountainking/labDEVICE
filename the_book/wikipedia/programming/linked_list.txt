Linked list

In computer science, a linked list is a
linear collection of data elements
whose order is not given by their
physical placement in memory. Instead,
each element points to the next. It is
a data structure consisting of a
collection of nodes which together
represent a sequence. In its most basic
form, each node contains data, and a
reference to the next node in the
sequence. This structure allows for
efficient insertion or removal of
elements from any position in the
sequence during iteration. More complex
variants add additional links, allowing
more efficient insertion or removal of
nodes at arbitrary positions. A
drawback of linked lists is that data
access time is linear in respect to the
number of nodes in the list. Because
nodes are serially linked, accessing
any node requires that the prior node
be accessed beforehand. Faster access,
such as random access, is not feasible.
Arrays have better cache locality
compared to linked lists.
