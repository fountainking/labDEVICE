Load balancing (computing)

In computing, load balancing is the
process of distributing a set of tasks
over a set of resources, with the aim
of making their overall processing more
efficient. Load balancing can optimize
response time and avoid unevenly
overloading some compute nodes while
other compute nodes are left idle.
