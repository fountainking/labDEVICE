PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL also known as Postgres, is a
free and open-source relational
database management system (RDBMS)
emphasizing extensibility and SQL
compliance. PostgreSQL features

consistency, isolation, durability
(ACID) properties, automatically
updatable views, materialized views,
triggers, foreign keys, and stored

It is supported on all major operating

single machines to data warehouses,
data lakes, or web services with many
concurrent users.
