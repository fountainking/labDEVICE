Virtual machine

In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is
the virtualization or emulation of a
computer system. Virtual machines are
based on computer architectures and
provide the functionality of a physical
computer. Their implementations may
involve specialized hardware, software,
or a combination of the two.
Virtual machines differ and are
organized by their function, shown
here:System virtual machines provide a
substitute for a real machine. They
provide the functionality needed to
execute entire operating systems. A
hypervisor uses native execution to
share and manage hardware, allowing for
multiple environments that are isolated
from one another yet exist on the same
physical machine. Modern hypervisors
use hardware-assisted virtualization,
with virtualization-specific hardware
features on the host CPUs providing
assistance to hypervisors.
Process virtual machines are designed
to execute computer programs in a
platform-independent environment.
