Graph theory

In mathematics and computer science,
graph theory is the study of graphs,
which are mathematical structures used
to model pairwise relations between
objects. A graph in this context is
made up of vertices which are connected
by edges. A distinction is made between
undirected graphs, where edges link two
vertices symmetrically, and directed
graphs, where edges link two vertices
asymmetrically. Graphs are one of the
principal objects of study in discrete
mathematics.
