Lisp (programming language)

Lisp is a family of programming
languages with a long history and a
distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix
notation.
Originally specified in the late 1950s,
it is the second-oldest high-level
programming language still in common
use, after Fortran. Lisp has changed
since its early days, and many dialects
have existed over its history. Today,
the best-known general-purpose Lisp
dialects are Common Lisp, Scheme,
Racket, and Clojure.
