Process (computing)

In computing, a process is the instance
of a computer program that is being
executed by one or many threads. There
are many different process models, some
of which are light weight, but almost
all processes are rooted in an
operating system (OS) process which
comprises the program code, assigned
system resources, physical and logical
access permissions, and data structures
to initiate, control and coordinate
execution activity. Depending on the
OS, a process may be made up of
multiple threads of execution that
execute instructions concurrently.
