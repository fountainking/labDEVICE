Content delivery network

A content delivery network (CDN) or
content distribution network is a
geographically distributed network of
proxy servers and corresponding data
centers. CDNs provide high availability
and performance ("speed") through
geographical distribution relative to
end users, and arose in the late 1990s
to alleviate the performance
bottlenecks of the Internet as it was
becoming a critical medium. Since then,
CDNs have grown to serve a large
portion of Internet content, including
text, graphics and scripts,
downloadable objects, applications,
live streaming media, on-demand
streaming media, and social media
services.
